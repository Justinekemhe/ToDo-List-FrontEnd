# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts
Prerequisites:

NodeJS (version 14 or later)
npm (Node Package Manager)
ReactJS

## Step 1: 
Clone the repository
First, you need to clone the repository of the Todo list application from a Git repository.

git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository-name>.git

## Step 2: 
Install Dependencies
Next, you need to install the dependencies for both the front-end and back-end. In the root directory of the project, open a terminal window and run the following command:

npm install
This command installs all the dependencies required for both the front-end and back-end.

## Step 3: 
Start the server
In the root directory of the project, open a terminal window and run the following command to start the NodeJS server:

npm start
This command starts the NodeJS server at http://localhost:3000.

## Step 4: 
Start the client
Next, open another terminal window and navigate to the client directory in the root directory of the project. Run the following command to start the ReactJS client:

npm start
This command starts the ReactJS client at http://localhost:3000.

## Step 5: 
View the application
Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000. You should see the Todo list application running in the web browser.

You can add, edit, and delete tasks in the Todo list application.

That's it! You have successfully set up and run the front-end (ReactJS) and back-end (NodeJS) for a Todo list application.
